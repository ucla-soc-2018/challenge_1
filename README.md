# Challenge 1

20 minutes one on one with an instructor  
We will each spend 10 minutes as the Driver  
We will each spend 10 minutes as the Navigator   
To complete Challege 1  

**driver** writes code (intelligent keyboardist - do not type ahead)  
**navigator** instructs what the driver should type  
At any point you do not know what to do, do not hesitate to ask your pair.
